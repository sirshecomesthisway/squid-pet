"""Regression tests for the 2026-08-19 fix: nudge hops were physically
moving the window in every backend state (by design -- see
WanderController.request_nudge's docstring) but the walking-cue never
showed unless she happened to already be in the "idle" backend state,
because PetApi.get_state() only forwarded sub_state to the frontend when
state=="idle". A user reported this made nudge look completely broken
while she was "working" or "sleeping" (mood, suppressed separately in the
frontend -- see index.html's applySubState, not covered by this file).

Fix: "nudge-{facing}" is a distinct sub_state name from the ambient
"walking-{facing}"/"looking-around-{facing}" wander sub-states, and is
exempt from the state=="idle" gate. Ambient wander sub-states keep the
original gating (they SHOULD stay invisible while busy/thinking/etc --
only nudge, a direct reaction to being bumped, is exempt).
