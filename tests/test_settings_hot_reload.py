"""StateMachine hot-reloads detector list when settings.json changes.

Task 3.4 of trigger-broadening: changing ~/.squid-pet/settings.json must
take effect without a Squid restart. Implementation in watcher.py polls
the file's mtime on every compute() and rebuilds detectors when it
changes. Tests below pin every observable behavior.
