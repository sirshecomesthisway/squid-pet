"""Pink-2026-06-29 follow-up: per-PID approval-wave eligibility.

After fixing the silent kill-switch bug, Pink reported that Squid
WOULD wave but never stopped, and waved for CPs she'd already replied
to. Root cause: per_process_max_idle_seconds is purely "longest idle"
with no concept of:

1. **Busy history.** A CP that was opened hours ago and never observed
   running anything still has a giant idle time. It shouldn't trigger
   an approval wave -- nothing is actually waiting.

2. **Snooze cap.** Once approval has been waving for 2 minutes without
   Pink interacting, give up. She's seen it and chose to defer. The
   wave should re-fire only if that CP cycles busy -> idle again
   (i.e. she replied and got a new response that's now awaiting input).

These tests pin down the new `per_process_pending_approval_idle()`
function's semantics. They use the lower-level _PER_PID dicts directly
rather than psutil so the logic is deterministic.
