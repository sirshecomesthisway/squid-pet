"""Tests for the per-pid cmdline cache -- CPU fix 3 (2026-09-03).

_find_processes_by_argv0_basename() had to call cmdline() on every one
of ~520 processes to find the handful of agent binaries, because
Process.name() lies about the `claude` binary (see
test_find_claude_code_processes). That is ~35ms, and it ran once per
agent per tick.

A process's argv is fixed once it has exec'd, so the answer can be
reused -- as long as we can prove it is still the SAME process. Identity
is (pid, create_time); create_time is free because psutil already
fetched it to build the Process object.
