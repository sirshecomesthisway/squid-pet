"""Tests for PetApi.acknowledge_approval(): a dblclick while she's waving
the approval_needed flag is an "I saw you" gesture. The bubble shows
immediately (see PetApi._pending_bubble / the RPC return value), but the
actual calm -- the snooze that makes the wave stop, same mechanic as the
right-click 'Calm Squid' menu action (PetApi._calm_squid /
_menu_calm_squid) -- is deliberately deferred by
ACKNOWLEDGE_DISMISS_DELAY_SEC via a background timer, so the wave keeps
visibly waving for that beat instead of stopping in the same instant the
bubble appears.

Follows the same __new__ + manual-attribute + MagicMock-observer pattern
as test_working_reannounce.py. threading.Timer is faked so tests don't
actually wait out the real delay or leave background threads running.
