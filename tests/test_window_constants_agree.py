"""Regression: constants must agree across window.py / wanderer.py / passthrough.py.

The 'top-edge strobe' bug of 2026-06-16 was caused by window.py bumping
WINDOW_HEIGHT from 220 -> 300 (for hearts headroom) while wanderer.py
was left at WIN_H = 220. The 80px mismatch caused the wanderer's edge
classifier to target positions above the visible frame, which then got
clamped — strobing the frontend edge-rotation at rhythm-walk frequency.
