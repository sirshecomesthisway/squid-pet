"""Pink-2026-06-30: harden the approval fallback to stop false-firing
for legacy CP processes that don't have the awaiting_input patch.

Two new behaviors:

1. **Auto-detect patched CPs.** If a PID has EVER been observed
   writing its awaiting_input flag, mark it as patched and SKIP the
   fallback for it. The direct signal is the only path of truth for
   patched CPs -- no CPU heuristic, no false fires from GC noise.

2. **Require sustained busy.** A single tick over the CPU threshold
   no longer adds a PID to _PER_PID_EVER_BUSY. We require N=3
   consecutive busy ticks. A real LLM call easily sustains 3 seconds
   of CPU; Python GC blips and prompt_toolkit redraws do not.
