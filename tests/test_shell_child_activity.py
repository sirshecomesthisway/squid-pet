"""Tests for watcher.shell_child_activity() -- CPU fix 2 (2026-09-03).

has_active_shell_children() and latest_shell_child_cmdline() each walked
the entire descendant tree of every agent process, and the second ran
only to re-find the child the first had already seen and discarded. At
1 Hz across two agents that is four full tree walks a second. This
merges them into ONE walk returning both signals.

The two signals deliberately disagree about wrapper shells -- see
SHELL_WRAPPER_NAMES -- so the merged walk carries two accumulators:
`active` latches on any SHELL_CHILD_NAMES match (wrappers included,
because a live wrapper IS evidence a tool is running), while `cmdline`
latches only on a non-wrapper match with a real cmdline.
