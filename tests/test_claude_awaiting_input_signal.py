"""Pink-2026-08-26: Claude-Code-native sibling of the legacy agent's
direct-signal tests (since removed).

Background: that agent's approval_needed alert was driven by a private
sitecustomize.py patch writing a PID-keyed flag file.
Claude Code has no equivalent private hook, but DOES have an official
Notification hook. scripts/claude_pet_hook.py is wired into
~/.claude/settings.json (Notification/UserPromptSubmit/SessionEnd) and
writes/removes ~/.squid-pet/claude_awaiting_input/<session_id> the same
way -- except keyed by session_id (no PID in the hook payload) instead
of PID, and with NO engagement gate (see filter_eligible_claude_sessions'
docstring for why one isn't needed here, unlike the legacy path's).

These tests exercise watcher.py's side only (claude_sessions_awaiting_input,
filter_eligible_claude_sessions, the compute() integration, and the
extended snooze_all_awaiting_now/count_currently_waving_pids). The hook
script itself (scripts/claude_pet_hook.py) is tested separately in
tests/test_claude_pet_hook_script.py by invoking it as a real subprocess.
