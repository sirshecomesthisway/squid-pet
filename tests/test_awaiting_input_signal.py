"""Pink-2026-06-29: replace CPU-heuristic approval detection with a
DIRECT signal from Code Puppy itself.

Background:
* `~/.code_puppy/llm_active.flag` already exists -- written by CP's
  sitecustomize.py monkey-patch when an LLM stream is in progress.
* This adds the SIBLING signal for the OTHER transition: when CP is
  sitting at the interactive prompt awaiting Pink's input.

Format: `~/.code_puppy/awaiting_input/<pid>` file per CP process.
Presence == that CP is at the prompt right now. Absence == it's not.

Squid scans the directory; any file whose PID is still alive
triggers `approval_needed` immediately, no CPU guessing needed.
Dead-PID files are evicted (CP crashed mid-prompt).
