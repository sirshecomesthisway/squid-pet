# state-detection Specification

## Purpose
Define how Squid infers what Code Puppy is doing on the user's Mac and
publishes that state to the frontend. Covers process detection, idle time
measurement, priority cascade for one-state-per-tick emission, JSON state
file publication, and the drowsy/user-wake-override layer for prolonged CP
idle periods.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Detect Code Puppy process activity

The watcher SHALL identify whether Code Puppy is currently running by scanning
`psutil.process_iter()` for processes whose command line contains either
`code-puppy` or `code_puppy`. Bash-wrapper processes SHALL be filtered out by
requiring `python` to also appear in the cmdline or the executable name to be
`code-puppy`.

#### Scenario: Code Puppy is running
- **WHEN** at least one matching Python process exists
- **THEN** `code_puppy_running` is `true` AND the aggregated CPU% across matches is reported

#### Scenario: Code Puppy is not running
- **WHEN** no matching process exists
- **THEN** `code_puppy_running` is `false` AND `cpu_percent` is `0.0`

### Requirement: Measure macOS user idle time

The watcher SHALL read macOS HID idle time via the `ioreg -c IOHIDSystem`
command, parse the `HIDIdleTime` value (nanoseconds), and convert to seconds.
No PyObjC or Accessibility permission SHALL be required for this read.

#### Scenario: User is active
- **WHEN** the user has produced input within the last second
- **THEN** `idle_seconds` is `< 2.0`

#### Scenario: User has stepped away
- **WHEN** there has been no mouse or keyboard input for 5+ minutes
- **THEN** `idle_seconds >= 300.0`

### Requirement: Emit exactly one state per tick using priority cascade

The watcher SHALL emit exactly one of seven states each tick, selected by a
priority cascade. Higher-priority conditions SHALL override lower-priority
ones. The order is:

1. `sleeping`
2. `celebrating` (sticky hold)
3. `idle` (when Code Puppy not running)
4. `grooving`
5. `concerned`
6. `working`
7. `thinking`
8. `idle` (default fallback)

#### Scenario: User is idle for 5+ minutes
- **WHEN** `idle_seconds >= 300`
- **THEN** state is `sleeping` regardless of any other signal

#### Scenario: CPU drops from busy to near-zero
- **WHEN** the previous tick was busy (CPU >= 5%) AND current CPU < 1.0%
- **THEN** state is `celebrating` AND this state is held for the next 4 seconds

#### Scenario: A subagent is active
- **WHEN** a `.pkl` file under `~/.code_puppy/subagent_sessions/` was modified within the last 30 seconds AND user is not idle AND not in a sticky celebrate
- **THEN** state is `grooving`

#### Scenario: A recent error was logged
- **WHEN** `~/.code_puppy/logs/errors.log` was modified within the last 60 seconds AND CPU < 5% AND no higher-priority state matched
- **THEN** state is `concerned`

#### Scenario: Code Puppy is busy and writing logs
- **WHEN** CPU >= 5% AND a session log file was modified within the last 5 seconds
- **THEN** state is `working`

#### Scenario: Code Puppy is busy but no recent log writes (LLM call)
- **WHEN** CPU >= 5% AND no session log was modified within the last 5 seconds
- **THEN** state is `thinking`

#### Scenario: No signals match
- **WHEN** none of the above conditions are met
- **THEN** state is `idle`

### Requirement: Publish state to JSON file

The watcher SHALL atomically write the current `PetState` (state, sub_state,
cpu_percent, idle_seconds, code_puppy_running, timestamp, message) to
`~/.squid-pet/state.json` once per tick using a `.tmp` + rename pattern.

#### Scenario: State changes
- **WHEN** a new state is computed
- **THEN** the file `~/.squid-pet/state.json` reflects the new state within one poll interval (1 second)

#### Scenario: File is being read by another process
- **WHEN** the writer flushes a new state while a reader is open
- **THEN** the reader observes either the old or the new state in full (never a partial write), because the writer uses `tmp.replace(STATE_FILE)`

### Requirement: Run as a daemon thread alongside the window

The watcher SHALL run as a daemon thread inside the main `squid_pet` process
with a configurable poll interval (default 1.0 second), and SHALL stop cleanly
when the window's `closing` event fires.

#### Scenario: Window is closed
- **WHEN** the user closes the pet window
- **THEN** the watcher thread observes the stop event within one poll interval and exits cleanly

### Requirement: Drowsy state for prolonged Code Puppy idle

An 8th emotional state, `drowsy`, SHALL be added to the state model. The
drowsy state SHALL be entered by the frontend (not the backend state
machine) when:
- The backend state has been `idle` continuously, AND
- `cp_idle_seconds` (Code Puppy's user-typed idle time) exceeds 120 seconds, AND
- No `user_wake_override` is currently active

The frontend SHALL play a slump animation when entering drowsy, and the
drowsy sprite SHALL persist until either Code Puppy resumes activity OR a
wake gesture fires.

Drowsy is intentionally a frontend-driven derivation rather than a backend
state to avoid coupling the watcher's state machine to user-gesture timing.

#### Scenario: Enter drowsy after prolonged idle
- **WHEN** the backend state is `idle`
- **AND** cp_idle_seconds is 121 or greater
- **AND** user_wake_remaining is 0
- **THEN** the frontend plays the slump animation
- **AND** the displayed sprite is the drowsy sprite

#### Scenario: Drowsy reverts when CP becomes active
- **WHEN** Squid is in the drowsy state
- **AND** Code Puppy starts a new tool call (CPU rises, log writes)
- **THEN** the backend state transitions to `thinking` or `working`
- **AND** the frontend swaps to the corresponding sprite

### Requirement: User-wake override channel suppresses drowsy

`PetApi` SHALL maintain a `_user_wake_until: float` epoch timestamp. The
`get_state()` response SHALL include a derived `user_wake_remaining`
field equal to `max(0, _user_wake_until - now)` in seconds.

The frontend SHALL treat `user_wake_remaining > 0` as a signal to:
- Suppress drowsy entry from the idle state
- Fire a wake-stretch transition if currently drowsy

The override SHALL be set by poke and swing-to-wake gestures. The override
SHALL NOT modify `cp_idle_seconds` (that field continues to reflect actual
CP activity).

`PetApi` SHALL also maintain a `_wake_trigger_seq: int` counter incremented
on every wake event. The frontend MAY use this counter to detect
"new wake event since last poll" without needing to compare timestamps.

#### Scenario: Poke during drowsy
- **WHEN** Squid is in the drowsy state
- **AND** the user pokes her
- **THEN** _user_wake_until is set to now + 60 seconds
- **AND** the next get_state response returns user_wake_remaining near 60
- **AND** the frontend fires the wake-stretch transition
- **AND** Squid does NOT re-enter drowsy for the next 60 seconds even if
       cp_idle_seconds remains above 120

#### Scenario: Override expires after 60 seconds
- **WHEN** 60 seconds have elapsed since the last wake gesture
- **AND** cp_idle_seconds is still above 120
- **AND** no new gesture has fired
- **THEN** user_wake_remaining returns 0
- **AND** the frontend re-enters drowsy on the next poll
