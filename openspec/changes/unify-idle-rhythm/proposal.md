# Proposal: Unify idle rhythm under a single routine controller

## Why

Squid currently has TWO competing autonomous-motion subsystems:

1. **`pulse.py`** — fixed-cadence heartbeat, fires `MICRO_PULSE` items every
   ~22s. But `MICRO_PULSE = ["look-around", "look-around", "look-around",
   "look-around"]` is a stub: rhythm exists in CADENCE only, not in
   BEHAVIOR variety.
2. **`wanderer.py`** — independent RNG scheduler: `random.uniform` and
   `random.choice` everywhere (lines 394, 404, 428, 546) to pick next
   wander destination, idle pause duration, edge-hop probability, etc.

The two systems do not coordinate. Pulse can fire `look-around` while the
wanderer is mid-walk, producing animation overlap. The wanderer's RNG
scheduling means consecutive wander steps can fire too close together
(jitter feels manic) or too far apart (Squid feels dead). Pink endorsed
the rhythmic-routine concept in the project memory under "future roadmap
- BUDDY patterns to steal".

## What changes

Introduce `routine.py` with a `RoutineController` that owns the idle
rhythm. It defines a deterministic-but-jittered sequence of actions:

```python
IDLE_ROUTINE = [
    ("rest",          15.0, 18.0),
    ("look-around",    1.5,  2.5),
    ("walk-short",     6.0, 10.0),
    ("rest",           8.0, 12.0),
    ("walk-medium",   12.0, 18.0),
    ("look-around",    1.0,  2.0),
    ("rest",          20.0, 30.0),
    ("walk-edge",     10.0, 16.0),
]
```

Each tuple is `(action_name, min_duration_s, max_duration_s)`. The
controller iterates the list circularly; each tick picks a uniform random
duration within the band, fires the action, sleeps the duration, advances
to the next item.

The **wanderer** is demoted to a stateless service exposing:
- `request_walk(distance_band: str)` — distance_band in `{"short", "medium", "edge"}`
- `request_look_around()` — fire the look-around mini-animation

No internal scheduling, no RNG. Routine calls in. Pulse goes away (its
role is subsumed by routine).

`is_busy()` gate semantics are preserved: when busy, the routine pauses
and Squid stays still.

**Mood gate (drowsy / sleeping / stretch):** the routine ALSO pauses
when the frontend mood is anything other than plain idle. Specifically:
- `drowsy` (cp_idle >= 120s) → routine pauses, saved index preserved
- `sleeping` (cp_idle >= 300s) → routine pauses, saved index preserved
- `stretch` (transient wake animation, ~1.6s) → routine pauses

On resume from `drowsy`, the routine continues at the saved index
(picking up where it left off). On resume from `sleeping`, the routine
RESETS to index 0 so Squid begins a fresh cycle (mirrors waking from a
real nap vs a deep sleep). The stretch transition is always a buffer
that finishes before any routine action fires.

Sprint-perimeter is a one-off invocation from the menu, not the routine,
so it is unchanged. Drowsy and sleeping mood-state thresholds live in
`state-detection` and remain unchanged in behavior.

**Bug fix bundled into this change:** the current code has two
inconsistent CP-idle thresholds for pausing motion — `pulse.py` and
`wanderer.py` both use `PAUSE_WHEN_CP_IDLE_SEC = 60.0`, but the frontend
doesn't enter `drowsy` until 120s. This produces a 60-120s window where
Squid is stationary but still looks awake. The new routine controller
SHALL pause based on frontend mood (the source of truth) rather than a
separate backend timer, eliminating the gap.

## Impact

Affects the canonical `autonomous-motion` capability:
- MODIFY the "Wanderer thread moves the window without user input"
  requirement to describe the routine-driven model
- ADD a new requirement: "Routine controller drives idle rhythm via
  deterministic sequence"
- Existing requirements for stroll modes, sprint-perimeter, busy-gate,
  drowsy entry stay AS-IS (semantics preserved, implementation moves
  into the wanderer-as-service or routine).
