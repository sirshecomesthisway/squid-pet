claude_pet_hook.py -- squid-pet's Claude Code hook receiver.

Wired into ~/.claude/settings.json under hooks.Notification,
hooks.UserPromptSubmit, hooks.SessionEnd, hooks.Stop, hooks.PreCompact,
hooks.PostCompact, hooks.PostToolUse, and hooks.PreToolUse (the last
matched to AskUserQuestion|ExitPlanMode). Maintains three per-session
flag-file signals that watcher.py reads:
  - "awaiting input" (claude_sessions_awaiting_input()) -- mirrors what
    the legacy agent's own sitecustomize.py patch did via a PID-keyed
    flag directory, except keyed by session_id, since Claude Code hook
    payloads carry no PID.
  - "just finished" (claude_sessions_just_finished()) -- Pink-2026-08-27f:
    replaces the old busy->idle heuristic edge (ClaudeCodeDetector
    watching shell/file/transcript-mtime activity drop) as the
    "celebrate" trigger. That heuristic could -- and did, confirmed
    live -- flip mid-task during an ordinary >20s gap with no tool call,
    producing a false "finished with claude!" bubble while Claude was
    still actively working. The official Stop hook fires exactly when
    Claude finishes responding and hands control back, which is what
    "worth celebrating" actually means -- same fix pattern as the
    Notification-hook migration above, applied to a different signal.
  - "recapping" (claude_sessions_recapping()) -- Pink-2026-08-30: Pink
    noticed Squid flashing to a generic "thinking" with no explanation
    during a context compaction (/compact or auto-compact) and asked
    for it to be called out by name. PreCompact/PostCompact bracket the
    compaction exactly, unlike any of the busy signals above (a compact
    is pure summarization -- no tool calls, no file writes).

Protocol:
  - Notification with notification_type == permission_prompt
    -> write <awaiting_input_dir>/<session_id>  (Claude is BLOCKED on you)
    idle_prompt is deliberately ignored -- see _HANDLED_NOTIFICATION_TYPES
  - PreToolUse with tool_name in {AskUserQuestion, ExitPlanMode}
    -> write <awaiting_input_dir>/<session_id>  (blocked on a human
    answer/approval that fires NO permission_prompt -- see
    _AWAITING_INPUT_TOOLS). The PostToolUse when you answer clears it.
  - UserPromptSubmit -> remove <awaiting_input_dir>/<session_id>  (you replied)
  - SessionEnd -> remove <awaiting_input_dir>/<session_id> and
    <recap_dir>/<session_id>  (session is gone)
  - Stop -> write <finished_dir>/<session_id>  (Claude just finished a turn)
  - PreCompact -> write <recap_dir>/<session_id>  (compaction starting)
  - PostCompact -> remove <recap_dir>/<session_id>  (compaction done)

No message/transcript content is ever read or written for any of these
signals -- session_id and mtime only, matching this project's stated
privacy stance (see ClaudeCodeDetector's docstring on why transcript
content is never read). Stop's payload includes a last_assistant_message
field; PreCompact's includes custom_instructions; both are deliberately
ignored. PreCompact's trigger field ("manual" vs "auto") is also
ignored for now -- Squid shows the same "recapping" bubble either way.

Confirmed empirically (2026-08-25/26, live Claude Code 2.1.239): the
Notification payload for both permission_prompt and idle_prompt includes
session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt_id, hook_event_name, message,
notification_type. UserPromptSubmit/SessionEnd/Stop are assumed to carry
session_id too (documented as a field common to every hook event) but
were NOT independently re-verified against a live payload the same way
-- that's what the always-on log below is for: check
~/.squid-pet/claude_hook.log after a real prompt-submit/session-end/stop
to confirm this script actually saw and handled them, without needing
another dedicated diagnostic pass. Also unverified: whether a Task-tool
subagent's completion fires this same top-level Stop event in addition
to its own SubagentStop (which this script does not handle) -- if the
log ever shows Stop firing implausibly often during subagent-heavy
sessions, that's the first thing to check. PreCompact/PostCompact are
documented (see Claude Code hooks-guide.md) but not yet independently
verified against a live payload either -- same log-based confirmation
applies after a real /compact.

Never raises past main(), never blocks Claude Code, always exits 0 -- a
bug here must not be able to interfere with normal Claude Code use. This
script deliberately has ZERO dependencies beyond the stdlib and does NOT
import the squid_pet package (the hook's execution environment has no
guarantee squid_pet is on PYTHONPATH).

Testability: the base directory (normally ~/.squid-pet) is read from the
SQUID_PET_HOME env var if set, so tests can point it at a tmp_path
without touching the real ~/.squid-pet.

# TOOLS, so PreToolUse fires right before they block, carrying tool_name.
# Treat those exactly like a permission_prompt: raise the awaiting-input

# Pink-2026-08-31: PostToolUse and Stop added after a confirmed stuck-wave
# bug. ANSWERING a permission prompt -- yes OR no -- fires no hook of any
# kind. Only UserPromptSubmit (you typed a new message) and SessionEnd (the
# session exited) were clearing the flag, so approving a prompt and letting
# Claude carry on left the flag set indefinitely: Squid waved for nine
# minutes at a session that was happily working, and because approval_needed
# takes PRIME over the whole cascade, every subsequent working/thinking state
# was masked behind it. Confirmed live in claude_hook.log, session 8ced357d:
# Notification WRITE permission_prompt -> Stop (so tools ran, i.e. it was
# approved) -> ... -> SessionEnd REMOVED, nine minutes later.
#
# The watcher has a self-heal for exactly this, but it is gated on
# len(find_claude_code_processes()) <= 1 (deliberately -- see its comment on
# the multi-session false-clear bug), and anyone running two sessions never
# gets it. These two events give a per-session signal that needs no such gate:
#
#   PostToolUse -- a tool actually executed. Proof the permission question
#                  was resolved and the session is no longer blocked on you.
#   Stop        -- the turn ended and control came back. Whatever it was
#                  waiting for, it is not waiting now. This is what covers
#                  DENIAL, where no tool ever runs and PostToolUse never
#                  fires.
#
# Neither can suppress a genuine wave: the next permission_prompt re-arms
# the flag on its own, whenever the session next actually blocks on you.
