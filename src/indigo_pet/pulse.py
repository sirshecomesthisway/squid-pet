"""
Indigo's micro-pulse: tiny in-place idle motions that keep her feeling alive
even when the wanderer is gated (pinned, or actively-working-and-still).

Inspired by Claude Code's BUDDY pet IDLE_SEQUENCE pattern -- rhythm beats
randomness. The pulse runs on a fixed-cadence schedule, NOT random:

    every PULSE_INTERVAL_SEC: pick the next action from MICRO_PULSE,
                              run it, advance the cursor.

The pulse ONLY uses substates that don't move the window. It never walks.
The wanderer still owns roaming. The pulse just makes her breathe:

  - "look-around-{facing}"  -- already a supported substate; head turn

Coexistence rule: if the wanderer is currently animating (sub_state already
set to walking/looking by the wander loop), the pulse skips this beat and
waits for the next one. Never fights the wanderer for the sub_state slot.
