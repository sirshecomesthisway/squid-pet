"""
Squid Pet Window — uses NSWindow directly for accurate positioning + dragging.

Why NSWindow direct: pywebview's window.move() can have origin issues on
multi-display setups. NSWindow's setFrameOrigin_ uses Cocoa's native bottom-left
origin and works correctly with NSScreen.visibleFrame.

Drag is implemented via JS mousemove → Python api.move_window_by() rather than
-webkit-app-region (which seems flaky in pywebview's WKWebView build).

        leaving it to nag for up to the full snooze window. No-ops
        (status="not-waving") for a dblclick at any other time, so the
        plain poke+heart behavior there is unaffected.

        Reuses the same snooze mechanic as the right-click 'Calm Squid'
        menu action (see _calm_squid) rather than deleting the
        awaiting-input flag file outright -- deleting would erase the
        ground-truth signal 'squid why' and the menu's own waving-count
        rely on to tell "seen and deferred" apart from "nothing
        pending" (see watcher.snooze_all_awaiting_now's docstring).

        Fires the dormant "like" bubble line on top of the usual hint
        pill, since this path is specifically the dblclick/heart
        gesture, not the menu. The bubble text is returned directly
        (not just stashed in self._pending_bubble for the next poll)
        because the watcher thread ticks independently every
        POLL_INTERVAL_SEC (~1s) -- if her natural next state (often
        "working", since that's frequently WHY you just acknowledged
        her) computes before the frontend's next ~800ms poll observes
        this bubble, that tick's own on_state_change bubble silently
        overwrites it and the ack is never seen. Returning it lets the
        caller show it immediately off the RPC response instead of
        racing the poll loop -- see the dblclick handler in
        index.html.

        Pink-2026-08-31: the actual calm (_calm_squid, which is what
        makes the wave stop) is deliberately deferred by
        ACKNOWLEDGE_DISMISS_DELAY_SEC via a background timer -- the
        bubble still appears instantly, but she keeps visibly waving
        for that beat first. Firing both in the same instant made the
        wave-stop and the bubble compete for attention at once; this
        way only the bubble is new at t=0, and the wave settling a
        second later reads as her having noticed, not as a hard cut."""
