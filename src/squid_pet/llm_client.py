"""
llm_client.py -- thin Walmart puppy-backend gateway client for Squid's
optional LLM-enriched speech bubbles.

Design constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
  1. Multi-tenant safe. The puppy_token is read from each user's own
     ~/.code_puppy/puppy.cfg at runtime. There is NO embedded token,
     no shared key, no fallback to the developer's credentials.
  2. The token is loaded once at startup, kept in memory only, and is
     NEVER written to any log line, state file, exception message, or
     telemetry. Tests assert this.
  3. If the token is missing or unreadable, the client silently disables
     itself. Squid keeps working with rule-based bubbles only.
  4. Failures (network, timeout, bad JSON, rate-limit) return None.
     The caller treats None as "no bubble this turn" -- never crash.
  5. Stdlib only. No new dependencies (urllib.request + json + ssl).
