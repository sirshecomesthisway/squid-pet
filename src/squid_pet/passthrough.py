"""
Pixel-perfect click passthrough for Squid.

Runs a background thread that:
  1. Polls global cursor position via NSEvent.mouseLocation()
  2. Maps cursor → window-local → sprite-local coords
  3. Reads alpha channel of currently-displayed sprite at that pixel
  4. Toggles NSWindow.setIgnoresMouseEvents_:
     - over opaque pixel (alpha > THRESHOLD) → ignore_mouse=False (clicks land on Squid)
     - over transparent pixel               → ignore_mouse=True  (clicks pass through)

Uses NSEvent.mouseLocation() which works regardless of window's ignore state,
so we can poll continuously and always know where the cursor is.

While the user is actively dragging Squid, passthrough is paused so dragging
doesn't accidentally toggle off mid-drag.
