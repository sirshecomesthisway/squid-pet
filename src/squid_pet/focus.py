"""focus.py -- "take me to the window that's waiting".

Pink-2026-09-01: double-clicking a waving Squid should land you in the
session that actually needs you, not merely acknowledge it.

Matching is by TTY, which is exact. A Claude Code process has a
controlling terminal (`/dev/ttysNNN`); Terminal.app exposes the same
value as `tty of tab`. Comparing those two identifies the precise tab,
with nothing inferred.

The first attempt matched the terminal TITLE against the session's
working directory, which meant recording cwd on the awaiting-input flag
and widening what docs/PRIVACY.md promises. It was then measured against
a live window and did not even work: Claude Code sets the title to a
summary of the current task ("pinksmac -- Squid demo script with status
mentions"), not the directory. TTY needs no new stored data at all, so
the flag's contents are unchanged.

Two levels, because only one is universally available:

  1. THE APP. watcher.find_terminal_app_bundle_for_claude_code() walks a
     claude process's parent chain to whichever terminal is hosting it --
     the same lookup terminal-notifier's -activate uses for the banner's
     Show button. Always available.
  2. THE TAB. Terminal.app only; its AppleScript dictionary exposes tabs
     and their ttys. iTerm2 models sessions differently and VS Code
     exposes no addressable terminal tab, so both fall back to (1).

Best-effort by nature: the hook payload carries no PID, so with several
sessions waiting there is no way to know which one fired -- the same
limitation find_terminal_app_bundle_for_claude_code documents.

    Pink asked for the same on every active sprite -- "except idle/drowsy/
    sleeping, because they mean she's doing nothing" -- and every active
    state already has a directory naming who caused it, so the same
    session -> project -> process -> tty -> tab chain covers them all.

    Resting states are absent by design, not by omission: with nothing
    running there is no window a double-click could honestly raise, and
    yanking one to the front would be worse than doing nothing.
