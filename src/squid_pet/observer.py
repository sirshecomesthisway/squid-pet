observer.py -- speech-bubble reaction layer for Squid.

Architecture: the Observer is a passive comment layer that:
  1. Watches state transitions reported by the StateMachine
  2. Watches direct user interactions reported by PetApi
  3. Returns short reaction strings (<= 32 chars) for the frontend bubble

It NEVER modifies pet state, NEVER intercepts Code Puppy, and NEVER produces
multi-line output. The voice lives entirely in the BUBBLE_LINES dict below
-- editing that dict is the canonical way to evolve Squid's personality.

# When an LLMClient is wired in, certain "rich-context" state transitions

# LLM call that may produce a more contextual bubble line. The rule-based
# bubble is published immediately as before -- the LLM line, if it
# arrives in time and respects the 32-char cap, overwrites it. If the LLM
# call fails, times out, returns empty, or returns too-long text, the
# rule-based bubble stays. Squid never goes silent because of LLM issues.
#
# Triggers NOT in this set keep their rule-based-only behavior:
#   - thinking/back_to_idle: too frequent, not enough context
