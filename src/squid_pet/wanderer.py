WanderController — SERVICE MODE.

After the unify-idle-rhythm refactor (2026-06-13), the wanderer no longer
owns its own scheduling loop. It exposes two fire-and-forget methods that
the RoutineController calls:

    wanderer.request_walk("short" | "medium" | "edge")
    wanderer.request_look_around()

Plus the still-internal `sprint_perimeter()` easter egg, which runs its
own thread and is invoked from the right-click menu.

Edge tracking is still done here (every walk updates the current edge
via _update_edge) because the frontend sprite rotation depends on it.

What got removed in service-mode:
  - `_loop`, `_tick`, `start()` thread spawn
  - `_idle_since`, `_next_wander_at` scheduling state
  - `STROLL_MODE_*`, `_stroll_mode`, `set_stroll_mode`, `get_stroll_mode`
  - `walk_to_nearest_corner` + `_pending_destination` queue
  - the old agent-idle pause constant + getter (routine owns mood gating)
  - `is_pinned`, `is_busy` constructor params (routine owns gating)

Why Python-side NSWindow moves (not CSS): pywebview's window is a real
NSWindow. CSS translations only move the sprite WITHIN the 200×220 viewport.
To actually roam the desktop we have to move the NSWindow itself.

        at rest exactly on a corner (both adjacent edges tied at distance
        0 -- always true for a walk that reached _pick_edge_destination's
        corner target, and common for a nudge/flee driven into a corner
        too), sticky classification keeps whichever edge she was locked

        vertical traverse or a sideways flee -- correct, that's what
        edge_hint/the per-tick tracking is FOR) -- but that's the wrong
        choice to SETTLE on: heart/speech-bubble placement (index.html)
        only has a dedicated layout for the "top" pose (bubble moved
        below the flipped face), not "left"/"right", so resting at a top
        corner still classified "left"/"right" leaves those decorations
        floating over her un-rotated top-of-window position, visibly
        misaligned with her actual (rotated) body.

        First fix (this same day) only added this call to _walk_to's
        end -- missed that _animate_hop (nudge/flee) has the exact same
        "can end at rest on a corner" shape and needed the identical
        settle, which is why a corner reached by fleeing a cursor nudge

        method instead of a second copy-pasted block -- anywhere else
        an animation loop grows the ability to end at a corner, it should
        call this too, not reinvent it.

        The plain classifier's bottom>top>left>right priority resolves a
        genuine corner tie in favor of "top" (or "bottom" at the bottom
        corners, which already matches the default un-rotated decoration
        layout) -- exactly the "hug the wall in transit, settle into the
        decorated pose on arrival" split the report asked for. A

        """"Edges" stroll mode only: where she should head to get away from
        the cursor while staying edge-pinned, given she's at or near a
        corner. Slide along whichever axis still has room (the other axis
        is already pinned at its away-from-cursor boundary), or -- if
        she's genuinely pinned on BOTH axes already (a true corner dead
        end, nowhere left in a straight line) -- turn 90 degrees and flee
        along whichever axis is NOT the dominant push direction, sliding
        to the far end of the edge she's already on.

        Returns an absolute (tx, ty) target. Shared by _flee_to_corner
        (jump straight there) and _do_request_nudge's corner-stuck
        fallback (lerp a short hop toward it) -- both need the exact same
        "which way is actually open" reasoning, just at different scales.

        Root-caused 2026-08-21 (Pink report): the small hop's stuck
        fallback used to ignore all this and just retarget "toward range
        center" projected via _compute_edge_at's fixed bottom>top>
        left>right priority -- at a top-right corner that always resolves
        to "top", so every stuck hop slid LEFT along the top edge
        regardless of which direction she was actually being pushed from.
        The very next push (still from the same side) then had real room
        again since she was no longer exactly cornered, hopping her back
        RIGHT onto the corner -- an endless left-right ping-pong that
        never turned the corner, instead of sliding down the right edge
        like a cornered nudge should.

        Dead-end axis pick (2026-08-21, follow-up): picking whichever
        ADJACENT corner is geometrically farther (raw Euclidean distance
        from the cursor) seemed reasonable but is dominated by the wander
        range's aspect ratio, not by which way she's actually being
        pushed -- in a wide-but-short range, "farther corner" nearly
        always resolves to the one across the WIDE dimension regardless
        of push direction (Pink report: pushed repeatedly straight left
        while cornered top-right, and the dead-end pick sent her to
        top-left, sideways, instead of down the already-open right edge).
        Comparing |dx| vs |dy| instead picks the axis by push direction
        directly: the LARGER of the two is the dominant/blocked push
        axis (that's exactly the one already pinned), so flee along the
        OTHER, smaller one.

        Sticky (2026-08-21, follow-up): real repeated pushes from
        roughly the same side never land at EXACTLY the same cursor
        position each time -- a few pixels of natural jitter flip dx/dy's
        sign push to push. Recomputing fresh on every call meant a
        single noisy push could reverse a bout of stuck hops/flees
        already in progress (verified via a repeated-push simulation:
        without stickiness she wobbled up and down an edge). Reusing the
        same target for STUCK_ESCAPE_STICKY_SEC after it's first picked
        means one noisy call can't undo it -- only a real lull (implying
        a fresh situation) lets this re-decide.

        Deliberately does NOT self-invalidate the moment she's reached
        the cached target (tried that, reverted it): once she's ARRIVED
        at, say, the bottom of a permanently-pinned right edge (cursor
        still pushing from the same side), a same-axis-ambiguous push
        (dy still ~0) re-evaluated fresh reproduces the exact same
        dead-end symmetry that put her there, and the 90-degree turn
        logic above has only ONE other option on a 2-ended edge -- the
        end she just left. Re-deciding on arrival therefore bounced her
        straight back to the original corner on the very next trigger.
        Simply outlasting the sticky window (worst case: one harmless
        no-op flee onto an already-occupied point, if a threshold fires
        again before it expires) is a much smaller cost than that.

        (2026-08-21, second follow-up: also tried gating the whole
        single-axis-pinned/dead-end branches on |dx|/|dy| exceeding a
        deadzone, treating a near-zero secondary axis as "no signal,
        stay put" instead of forcing a direction. Reverted -- real
        continuous left/right pushing produces exactly this near-zero dy
        by nature (confirmed via simulation with realistic +/-3px
        jitter, well under any deadzone that would also filter out
        genuine small pushes), so "no signal" is the COMMON case here,
        not an edge case -- gating on it made her freeze in place
        instead of turning down the edge, reproducing the original
        reported bug. The sticky cache above already handles the
        practically-important case (steady progress during an active
        push); an eventual bounce-back after minutes of uninterrupted
        pushing at a fixed spot is a smaller cost than that regression)."""

        whichever corner of her wander range is furthest from the cursor.

        Deliberately picks the corner AWAY FROM THE CURSOR, not the corner
        nearest her current position (2026-08-19 bug: with the old
        nearest-to-self pick, a few short 70px hops away from the cursor
        often weren't enough to cross over to the far half of the wander
        range, so "nearest corner" was still on the cursor's side -- she'd
        flee right back toward whoever was nudging her).

        The raw (away_x, away_y) pick moves on BOTH axes at once -- fine in
        "anywhere" stroll mode, but in "edges" mode (the default) she's
        normally already pinned to one edge, and jumping to a corner on a
        DIFFERENT edge reads as an off-edge diagonal cut across open space
        (2026-08-21, Pink report: nudging her twice sent her diagonally
        instead of sliding along the edge she was already on). In "edges"
        mode, constrain movement to whichever axis actually has room:
        an axis where she's already sitting at its away-target boundary
        contributes no movement, and the OTHER axis carries the whole
        move -- a straight slide to the corner at the end of whichever
        edge she can still travel along.

        This is deliberately NOT just "project onto _compute_edge_at's
        single classified edge": AT a corner she's simultaneously pinned
        on both axes, and that classifier only returns ONE edge (fixed
        bottom>top>left>right priority), so it can pick the very edge
        with no room left in the away direction and collapse the whole
        move to a no-op (2026-08-21 report #2: nudged from the right
        while already in the bottom-left corner -- away_x correctly had
        no room, but projecting onto the classifier's "bottom" edge also
        reset the already-correct away_y back to her current y, instead
        of letting her slide up the left edge to the top-left corner).

        Dead-end turn (2026-08-21): if she's already sitting exactly at
        the away corner on BOTH axes, there's no straight-line room left
        at all -- turn 90 degrees instead of freezing in place. Pick
        whichever of the two corners ADJACENT to this one (sharing a
        single edge with it, not the diagonal-opposite) ends up farther
        from the cursor, and slide there. Applies regardless of
        stroll_mode -- "anywhere" mode's away_x/away_y is just as capable
        of landing her back on a corner she's already occupying.

        All of the above (axis-constrained slide, dead-end 90-degree

        Strategy:

        Returns (tx, ty, edge) -- `edge` is the wall this specific walk
        slides along, decided HERE from the same branch that picked
        (tx, ty), and handed to _rotate_first_preamble as an authoritative
        hint instead of being re-derived later.

        Pink-2026-08-29 (recurring report, "walking up the left/right
        edge still shows feet-up"): every corner is a geometric tie
        between two edges (e.g. top-left ties left(0) and top(0)), so
        re-deriving the edge from (tx, ty) alone after the fact -- as the
        old code did via _compute_edge_at_preferring in
        _rotate_first_preamble -- can only resolve that tie by guessing
        (fixed bottom>top>left>right priority, or "prefer whatever edge
        she happened to be tracked as before this walk"). Both guesses
        fail whenever she arrives at a corner via one wall (e.g. tracked
        edge = "bottom") and then picks a walk that slides along a
        DIFFERENT wall to the opposite end of THAT wall (e.g. up the left
        edge to the top-left corner): the destination ties left/top, her
        incoming tracked edge is "bottom" (matches neither side of the
        tie), so the priority fallback picks "top" (feet-up) for the
        entire vertical traverse instead of "left" (feet hugging the
        wall) -- exactly the reported symptom, and not the same case the
        2026-08-27i same-edge-tie fix covered (that fix only helps when
        the tracked edge already equals one side of the tie).
        There is no ambiguity to resolve at the source: this function
        already knows definitively which wall (tx, ty) slides along --
        it just picked it. Passing that through removes the guess
        entirely instead of refining it further.
